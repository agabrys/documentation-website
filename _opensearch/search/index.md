# Searching data

Expectations from search engines have evolved over the years. Just returning relevant results quickly is no longer enough for most users. OpenSearch includes many features that enhance the userâ€™s search experience as follows:

Feature | Description
:--- | :---
[Autocomplete functionality]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/search/autocomplete) | Suggest phrases as the user types.
[Did-you-mean functionality]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/search/autocomplete) | Spell-check phrases as the user types.
[Paginate results]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/search/paginate) |  Rather than a single, long list, break search results into pages.
[Sort results]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/search/sort) | Allow sorting results by different criteria.
[Highlight query matches]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/search/highlight) | Highlight the search term in the results.

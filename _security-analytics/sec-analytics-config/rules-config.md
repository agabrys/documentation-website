# Creating rules

Security analytics supports the 2,000 [Sigma rules](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma) and pre-packages them with each installation. Sigma is a generic signature format for security information and event management (SIEM) solutions. The specification provides an easy-to-write, flexible format that is applicable to any type of log file.

The multiple data sources plugin is an experimental feature with OpenSearch 2.4. Therefore, we do not recommend using it in a production environment. For updates on the progress or if you want leave feedback that could help improve the feature, see the [data source plugin issue on GitHub](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/pull/2448).
